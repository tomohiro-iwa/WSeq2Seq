Merge pull request #2942 from google/sync-master-2017/09/18
Fixes #2905
Fix external bug #2751.
Fix #1190
Completely overhaul top-level javadoc for common.graph interfaces in light of the new interface hierarchy. Spend a lot of time answering what I think will be the #1 question users have: should I use a Graph or a Network? Spend a lot less time defining graph theory terms, that's what wikipedia is for :) plus the method-level javadoc defines terms as necessary. Overall, make it a lot more concise. Javadoc that's too long for anyone to bother reading is just as good as javadoc that doesn't exist!
