Issue #206 Use a discard policy rather than an abort policy for the housekeeping thread, the abort policy causes unnecessary looping in addConnection() during shutdown() due to the housekeeping thread being used as the executor for the setNetworkTImeout() call.  We could create another executor just for that, but it doesn't really make sense or matter.

Completely overhaul top-level javadoc for common.graph interfaces in light of the new interface hierarchy. Spend a lot of time answering what I think will be the #1 question users have: should I use a Graph or a Network? Spend a lot less time defining graph theory terms, that's what wikipedia is for :) plus the method-level javadoc defines terms as necessary. Overall, make it a lot more concise. Javadoc that's too long for anyone to bother reading is just as good as javadoc that doesn't exist!
