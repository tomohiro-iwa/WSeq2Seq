add alloc/free_transfer_and_buffer. Manages the buffer memory on the C side.
switch libusb.go to use the new alloc/free_transfer_and_buffer. Add a new buffer() call to get access to the allocated buffer as a Go slice.
Fake USB transfer uses the new alloc/free/buffer interface.
Switch to the new libusb.alloc signature, where libusb owns the buffer.
newUSBTransfer now allocates a separate buffer, do a copy on endpoint.transfer.
Set autodetach to true.
In free(), remove Go references to the C memory before the C memory itself is released. That ensures that a concurrent alloc() will not try to insert the same pointer into the map that was not yet removed.
Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master' into alloc_cgo_memory
first implementation of the write stream transfer
move ReadStream-only fields to ReadStream directly.
Proper error handling on errors on submit vs wait - flush all remaining transfers if error is encountered on wait.
Make the stream structure a bit cleaner, hopefully...
Add an OutEndpoint.NewStream to create a WriteStream.
Merge branch 'write_stream' of https://github.com/google/gousb into write_stream
Add endpoint write stream test.
Merge branch 'master' into write_stream
Remove unusued Timeout field. Add methods that take explicit context for endpoints and streams.
Tests for endpoint with context.
Merge branch 'master' into context
support cancellation on test transfers. Replace ctx.TODO with ctx.Background, as I don't expect we'll get a t.Context() anytime soon.
verbose comments on Read*/Write*
Merge branch 'master' into context
Make stream context-less, instead accept the context in ReadContext/WriteContext on the stream. This makes a stream compatible with the endpoint in terms of signatures. Stream context can still be controlled by the caller, essentially by passing the same context to all calls.
add timeout support using ReadContext.
update docs
Replace explicit TransferTimedOut with just cancel + wait for the transfer to return, it will automatically return a TransferCanceled error. Update docs.
s/resuling/resulting/
test for partial read/write in ReadContext/WriteContext test.
add IdxSerial, IdxProduct and IdxManufacturer to DeviceDesc to have indices for GetStringDescriptor() to get the values
introduce new API function for get the SerialNumber, Product and Manufacturer
Add Device.Manufacturer(), .Product() and .SerialNumber()
Address review comments
Review comments 2
This commit adds support for TCP MD5 auth in metallb. The default net.Conn object is replaced by  low level syscalls that create the FD's set the sockopts directly, as TCP MD5  sockopts have to be set before the connection is made.
Missed debug log
fixing minor lint tests
This commit fixes several comments raised in the PR review: 1. laddr, err := net.ResolveTCPAddr ... Has been moved to DiaTCP function 2. ctx deadline has been reused in  DialTCP,  but its Timeout functionality has not been    reintegrated, only the deadline. 3. Removed custom TTL 4. DialTCP returns net.Conn not *net.TCPConn 4. Removed some doubtful sockopt that could introduced innefficiency 5. Removed the poller, which came from the original gobgp code.
Adding a bugix for timeouts and failed connections

Added basic scatter plot charts and a point series renderer.
The point renderer will now use the assigned symbol renderer to draw the points. Each series, and each datum in said series, can be configured to use a custom symbol renderer, matched by ID string. If no series renderer is defined for a point, or for its series, then the point renderer will fall back to the default symbol renderer.

Fixed some tests for more strict Dart2 typing
Add missing equality checks to chart behaviors.
Change to set viewport on configure of the axis. Change ordinal scale to save viewport and set on update scale instead, which allows calling set viewport on configure. Move example code under axes and added clarifications.
Added a comparison point decorator for scatter plot charts. This decorator will render a "comparison" shape underneath the point for the main series data. It will be bounded by the points (lowerDomainBound, lowerMeasureBound) and (upperDomainBound, upperMeasureBound).
Add behavior for setting initial selection on a chart.

Add behavior for setting initial selection on a chart.
Changing the Github version of charts_flutter dependency to point to local path. This allows for more frequent Github syncing without requiring charts_common package to be published each time Github is synced. This also makes it easier for the open source community to tinker with the charts code - if someone makes a change in charts_common they would not have to also edit the pubspec.yaml file to use their changes in charts_flutter.
Fix default stroke width to expected type of double.
Fix Dart2 typing when using SelectionModelConfig for chart types Bar, Line, Pie, Scatter Plot.
Refactor Legend & Hovercard SymbolRenderer allowing chart_common SymbolRenderers to be supported directly in charts_flutter

Added labels for pie charts.
Added combo chart examples.
Expose LegendContentBuilder for SeriesLegend to allow users to build custom legends. Expose TickFormatter to allow users to build custom tick formatters.
Temporary workaround for line/time series charts to render null measure values as zero until null measure rendering is implemented.
Ensure that the renderers default a SymbolRenderer so they work with Legends a little easier.
Internal changes
The domain axis baseline will now be drawn on top of measure axis gridlines, instead of below the one at the bottom of the chart.
Added a symbol annotation renderer, which draws annotation data in a channel between the chart draw area and the axes.
Fixes for tests broken by dart2
Improved selection behaviors when used with SymbolAnnotationRenderer.
SelectNearest was renamed SelectionTrigger
Added a Slider behavior, which draws a draggable line with a handle over the chart. Event callbacks can be registered for drag position changes, and the end of the drag action.
Internal changes
Add ability to set dash pattern or turn off dash pattern for line point highlighter.
Clip canvas in line renderer when painting line or area so that line or area does not draw beyond the draw area. Removed the previous incorrect solution that only adds points within the draw area, which was incorrect because the first and last points within the draw area of the chart wouldn't draw a line toward the point outside of the chart.
Update gallery images.
When behavior, axis, or renderer configuration changes, set flag that will cause a chart draw when Flutter chart renderer object is reconfigured.
Fix bug where selection model is not cleared when series list changes.
Added a PercentInjector behavior, which can can inject series or domain percentages into each datum. The measure values of each datum will be replaced by the percent of the total measure value that each represents. The "raw" measure accessor function on [MutableSeries] can still be used to get the original values. Moved "interactions" examples to "behaviors" folder to make it a generic catch-all.
Add option for series legends to show measure values and to format the measure values.
Fix bug where measure viewport is sometimes incorrectly set to 0-1 after panning.
Internal change
Added a bar lane renderer, which draws gray lanes "underneath" the bars. Added a "middle" position for BarLabelDecorator.
NumericTickFormatter and the corresponding spec now takes in a callback for formatting measures. NumericFormat can still be used by using named constructor withNumericFormat
Documentation cleanup.
Numeric tick provider will now provide valid ticks if the data range includes both negative and positive values.
Fix panning fling slowness.
Added pan/zoom completed listener.
Fix missing equality and hashcode overrides for axis specs.
Internal changes
Line renderer will now render changes in style between data points in a line as separate line and area segments.
The PercentAxisSpec will now generate more than just two ticks by default.
Added a bucketing numeric axis which will group all values below a certain threshold into a "gutter" at the bottom of the draw area.
Add initial hint behavior for cartesian charts. This is most commonly used with pan/zoom behavior to hint to the user that pan/zoom is available.
Bar target line renderer will now be clipped inside the chart draw area.
Internal changes.
Internal changes
BarRendererConfig modified to accept type other than string, so that bar renderer could be used in a non ordinal axis.
Streamlined charts_flutter exports by exporting files transitively from common.dart.

Global third_party/ CL renaming Dart 1 ALL CAPS CONSTANTS to Dart 2 camel case versions.  Dart 1 constant names were deprecated and will be removed shortly.
Handle null point locations when getting line point highlighter's current points. This occurs when there is null data.
Proxy gesture listener should not try to call null callbacks.
Do not keep formatted tick caches if tick formatter changes.

When Java raises a CharacterCodingException, the catch block rethrows this exception as a java.lang.Error.  Per the docs https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Error.html an Error is a serious problem that applications should not attempt to catch such as ThreadDeath.  In this case, it is reasonable for a consumer to try to catch this error as it likely indicates a problem with the underlying data.

Adding new library benchmark_main that is essentially baseline benchmark library + BENCHMARK_MAIN() compiled in. This provides consistency with gtest_main. Also converting all the tests to use benchmark_main. To ensure backward-compatibility, old library benchmark is left intact, and new test no_main_test is added to make sure that this scenario is not broken.
Fixing some tests to link agains benchmark (the one that doesn't have BENCHMARK_MAIN), since tests in question had their custom main functions.
Updating documentation to mention benchmark_main library.

Provide a conformance test suite for blob.Bucket, and have all 3 provider implementations call it. -- Some tests are commented out because they don't pass for all providers; there are TODOs and issue references for these. -- I did the best I could to make the tests the union of all previous tests, but I did drop the tests that were specific to provider-specific bucket or blob naming rules; I don't think these were useful tests for our implementation.
Use t.Fatal instead of t.Error in a couple of places where doing otherwise could panic. Always delay when checking ModTime; filestore doesn't use --record and fails without it.

allow the correctness test to compare learner's output if the output is an array of strings
1. Use angular.isArray() to exmaine if an input is array; 2. Use Array.some() to check if any of the learner's output matches allowed outputs
Use cleaner way to compare array as Sean suggested: previously it used stringified version of arrays and then do comparison. this iteration use angular.equals(arrayA, arrayB) which is cleaner and more efficient.

1. Use angular.isArray() to exmaine if an input is array; 2. Use Array.some() to check if any of the learner's output matches allowed outputs
Use cleaner way to compare array as Sean suggested: previously it used stringified version of arrays and then do comparison. this iteration use angular.equals(arrayA, arrayB) which is cleaner and more efficient.
