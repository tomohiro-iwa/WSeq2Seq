add alloc/free_transfer_and_buffer . Manages the buffer memory on the C side .
switch libusb . go to use the new alloc/free_transfer_and_buffer . Add a new buffer ( ) call to get access to the allocated buffer as a Go slice .
Fake USB transfer uses the new alloc/free/buffer interface .
Switch to the new libusb . alloc signature , where libusb owns the buffer .
newUSBTransfer now allocates a separate buffer , do a copy on endpoint . transfer .
newUSBTransfer will now allocate it ' s own buffer .
Set autodetach to true .
In free ( ) , remove Go references to the C memory before the C memory itself is released . That ensures that a concurrent alloc ( ) will not try to insert the same pointer into the map that was not yet removed .

Internal changes .
Minor optimization , reuse domainIndex .
Expose TickFormatterSpec and SimpleTickFormatterBase to allow users to create their own custom tick formatter .
Clean up typing in Axis , TickProvider , and Scale .
Added basic scatter plot charts and a point series renderer .
Line charts can now render points on the line .
The point renderer will now use the assigned symbol renderer to draw the points . Each series , and each datum in said series , can be configured to use a custom symbol renderer , matched by ID string . If no series renderer is defined for a point , or for its series , then the point renderer will fall back to the default symbol renderer .
Fixed bug when zoomed into a line chart , the line was drawing beyond the chart draw area .
Bar renderer clips bars that extend beyond the draw area bounds .
When panning , new ticks will be generated .
Added " tap to hide " behavior to series legends . Tapping on an entry in the legend will hide its related data on the chart .

Fixed some tests for more strict Dart0 typing
Add missing equality checks to chart behaviors .
Change to set viewport on configure of the axis . Change ordinal scale to save viewport and set on update scale instead , which allows calling set viewport on configure . Move example code under axes and added clarifications .
Added a comparison point decorator for scatter plot charts . This decorator will render a " comparison " shape underneath the point for the main series data . It will be bounded by the points ( lowerDomainBound , lowerMeasureBound ) and ( upperDomainBound , upperMeasureBound ) .
Add behavior for setting initial selection on a chart .
Changing the Github version of charts_flutter dependency to point to local path . This allows for more frequent Github syncing without requiring charts_common package to be published each time Github is synced . This also makes it easier for the open source community to tinker with the charts code - if someone makes a change in charts_common they would not have to also edit the pubspec . yaml file to use their changes in charts_flutter .
Fix default stroke width to expected type of double .
Fix Dart0 typing when using SelectionModelConfig for chart types Bar , Line , Pie , Scatter Plot .
Refactor Legend & Hovercard SymbolRenderer allowing chart_common SymbolRenderers to be supported directly in charts_flutter

Internal changes .
Minor optimization , reuse domainIndex .
Expose TickFormatterSpec and SimpleTickFormatterBase to allow users to create their own custom tick formatter .
Clean up typing in Axis , TickProvider , and Scale .
Added basic scatter plot charts and a point series renderer .
Line charts can now render points on the line .
The point renderer will now use the assigned symbol renderer to draw the points . Each series , and each datum in said series , can be configured to use a custom symbol renderer , matched by ID string . If no series renderer is defined for a point , or for its series , then the point renderer will fall back to the default symbol renderer .
Fixed bug when zoomed into a line chart , the line was drawing beyond the chart draw area .
Bar renderer clips bars that extend beyond the draw area bounds .
When panning , new ticks will be generated .
Added " tap to hide " behavior to series legends . Tapping on an entry in the legend will hide its related data on the chart .
Added " tap to hide " behavior to series legends . Tapping on an entry in the legend will hide its related data on the chart .
Added " tap to hide " behavior to series legends . Tapping on an entry in the legend will hide its related data on the chart .

Update example to remove specifying the datum generic when creating a new chart .
Add ability to set viewport for axis using axis spec .
Added support for rendering area skirts to line charts .
Added support for configurable fill colors to bar charts . When a fillColorFn is supplied for a series , it will be used as the fill color for the bar . The colorFn result will be used as a stroke color , if a stroke width is also provided .
Fixed some tests for more strict Dart0 typing
Add missing equality checks to chart behaviors .
Change to set viewport on configure of the axis . Change ordinal scale to save viewport and set on update scale instead , which allows calling set viewport on configure . Move example code under axes and added clarifications .
Added a comparison point decorator for scatter plot charts . This decorator will render a " comparison " shape underneath the point for the main series data . It will be bounded by the points ( lowerDomainBound , lowerMeasureBound ) and ( upperDomainBound , upperMeasureBound ) .
Add behavior for setting initial selection on a chart .
Changing the Github version of charts_flutter dependency to point to local path . This allows for more frequent Github syncing without requiring charts_common package to be published each time Github is synced . This also makes it easier for the open source community to tinker with the charts code - if someone makes a change in charts_common they would not have to also edit the pubspec . yaml file to use their changes in charts_flutter .
Fix default stroke width to expected type of double .
Fix Dart0 typing when using SelectionModelConfig for chart types Bar , Line , Pie , Scatter Plot .
Refactor Legend & Hovercard SymbolRenderer allowing chart_common SymbolRenderers to be supported directly in charts_flutter
Expose CornerRadiusStrategy so users can customize corner radius size for bar renderer using BarRendererConfig .

Fixed #00
fix pie chart for single items
Added labels for pie charts .
Added combo chart examples .
Expose LegendContentBuilder for SeriesLegend to allow users to build custom legends . Expose TickFormatter to allow users to build custom tick formatters .
Temporary workaround for line/time series charts to render null measure values as zero until null measure rendering is implemented .
Ensure that the renderers default a SymbolRenderer so they work with Legends a little easier .
Internal changes
The domain axis baseline will now be drawn on top of measure axis gridlines , instead of below the one at the bottom of the chart .
Added a symbol annotation renderer , which draws annotation data in a channel between the chart draw area and the axes .
Fixes for tests broken by dart0
Improved selection behaviors when used with SymbolAnnotationRenderer .
SelectNearest was renamed SelectionTrigger
Added a Slider behavior , which draws a draggable line with a handle over the chart . Event callbacks can be registered for drag position changes , and the end of the drag action .
Internal changes
Add ability to set dash pattern or turn off dash pattern for line point highlighter .
Clip canvas in line renderer when painting line or area so that line or area does not draw beyond the draw area . Removed the previous incorrect solution that only adds points within the draw area , which was incorrect because the first and last points within the draw area of the chart wouldn ' t draw a line toward the point outside of the chart .
Update gallery images .
Added optional weight patterns to the bar renderer , which control the ratio of the width of bars in a group .
When behavior , axis , or renderer configuration changes , set flag that will cause a chart draw when Flutter chart renderer object is reconfigured .
Fix bug where selection model is not cleared when series list changes .
Added a PercentInjector behavior , which can can inject series or domain percentages into each datum . The measure values of each datum will be replaced by the percent of the total measure value that each represents . The " raw " measure accessor function on [MutableSeries] can still be used to get the original values . Moved " interactions " examples to " behaviors " folder to make it a generic catch-all .
Fix panning bug where panning does not work if it is the first gesture unless tapping down and holding before panning .
Add option for series legends to show measure values and to format the measure values .
Fix bug where measure viewport is sometimes incorrectly set to 0-0 after panning .
Internal change
Added a bar lane renderer , which draws gray lanes " underneath " the bars . Added a " middle " position for BarLabelDecorator .
NumericTickFormatter and the corresponding spec now takes in a callback for formatting measures . NumericFormat can still be used by using named constructor withNumericFormat
Documentation cleanup .
Numeric tick provider will now provide valid ticks if the data range includes both negative and positive values .
Fix panning fling slowness .
Added pan/zoom completed listener .
Fix missing equality and hashcode overrides for axis specs .
Add behavior to center the viewport on selected domain .
Internal changes
Line renderer will now render changes in style between data points in a line as separate line and area segments .
The PercentAxisSpec will now generate more than just two ticks by default .
Added a bucketing numeric axis which will group all values below a certain threshold into a " gutter " at the bottom of the draw area .
Add initial hint behavior for cartesian charts . This is most commonly used with pan/zoom behavior to hint to the user that pan/zoom is available .
Bar target line renderer will now be clipped inside the chart draw area .
Line renderer will now handle null measure values by rendering a break in the series . Isolated data points that exist between null values will be rendered as single points .
Internal changes .

When Java raises a CharacterCodingException , the catch block rethrows this exception as a java . lang . Error . Per the docs https : //docs . oracle . com/javase/0/docs/api/java/lang/Error . html an Error is a serious problem that applications should not attempt to catch such as ThreadDeath . In this case , it is reasonable for a consumer to try to catch this error as it likely indicates a problem with the underlying data .

Adding new library benchmark_main that is essentially baseline benchmark library + BENCHMARK_MAIN ( ) compiled in . This provides consistency with gtest_main . Also converting all the tests to use benchmark_main . To ensure backward-compatibility , old library benchmark is left intact , and new test no_main_test is added to make sure that this scenario is not broken .
Fixing some tests to link agains benchmark ( the one that doesn ' t have BENCHMARK_MAIN ) , since tests in question had their custom main functions .

Merge branch ' master ' of https : //github . com/google/tie into list_of_string_as_output To update with the master .
allow the correctness test to compare learner ' s output if the output is an array of strings
0 . Use angular . isArray ( ) to exmaine if an input is array ; 0 . Use Array . some ( ) to check if any of the learner ' s output matches allowed outputs
Use cleaner way to compare array as Sean suggested : previously it used stringified version of arrays and then do comparison . this iteration use angular . equals ( arrayA , arrayB ) which is cleaner and more efficient .

Merge branch ' master ' of https : //github . com/google/tie into list_of_string_as_output To update with the master .
allow the correctness test to compare learner ' s output if the output is an array of strings
0 . Use angular . isArray ( ) to exmaine if an input is array ; 0 . Use Array . some ( ) to check if any of the learner ' s output matches allowed outputs
Use cleaner way to compare array as Sean suggested : previously it used stringified version of arrays and then do comparison . this iteration use angular . equals ( arrayA , arrayB ) which is cleaner and more efficient .
